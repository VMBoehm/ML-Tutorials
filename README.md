# ML-Tutorials
Machine Learning Tutorials

a collection of well commented examples of some standard machine learning techniques

- classification (with fully connected and convolutional neural nets)
- regression
- data compression (with pca and a pretarined vae)

## Requirements
- no requirements if run on google colab (https://colab.research.google.com/).
- otherwise
  - tensorflow (https://keras.io/)
  - tensorflow-hub (pip install tensorflow-hub)
  - tensorflow-probablity (pip install --upgrade tensorflow-probability)
  - KERAS (https://keras.io/)
  - scikit learn (https://scikit-learn.org/)
